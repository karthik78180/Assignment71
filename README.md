Image file for database table design and java class design is attached with this thread and requirement instruction is given below: 

1. This is a highly contrived example database holding information for a collection of flowershops. Each flowershop sells different types of flowers; the weekly sales of each flower type per shop is persisted in the database. Each shop also is run by various managers. 
2. Write fully functional POJO Java class files (Flowershop and Manager) based on the database tables and the requirements. Make sure to write all methods required for Hibernate to work properly. 
3. Include all the Hibernate5 and JAXB annotations necessary to implement the requirements. Please include all annotations, as if you were going to override the default values. Hibernate-specific annotations are okay. No hbm.xml files please. 
4. You may assume that the XML tag is the same as the Java property name.
